==  GitHub.com account

Sign up for a free GitHub account by going to https://github.com and clicking
the `Sign Up` button. You are welcome to use an existing personal GitHub account if have one. *Please e-mail me your GitHub username once you have an account setup.* Do not send me your GiHub password. Every assignment in this class is submitted using GitHub repositories.

== Slack account
Sign up for a free Slack account at https://ustseis665.slack.com/signup using
your @stthomas.edu email address. Slack is
a chat-based collaborative platform used by thousands of organizations. It is heavily
used in DevOps organizations.

You can access Slack using a web browser or you can download a desktop application
(https://slack.com/downloads). Slack is also available as an app for your mobile
device. This course doesn't teach you how to use Slack, but it's pretty easy
to figure out. Just go to the Slack website and click on the `Getting Started` link
to learn the basics.

We will use Slack as a group communication tool throughout the course. If you have a
question or encounter a problem while working with a tool, you should ask your
question on Slack first. Students that actively participate on Slack and assist
other students with issues may receive extra credit points.

Note that even though we will use Slack as a collaboration tool, students must
complete and submit their own work on assignments. Some of the exam questions
will relate to the assignments, and students that don't complete the assignments
on their own will have difficulty taking the exams.

== AWS account

We will use Amazon Web Services extensively throughout the course to learn how
to work with cloud-based infrastructure. You are required to setup an AWS account
to complete many of the assignments. You may use an existing school AWS
account for the class as long as it is associated with your UST email account. 
*You must provide a valid credit card when signing up for an AWS account*.

Amazon offers a _free_ tier of service for users with new accounts. This free tier
lasts for one year after the account is registered. Additionally, since the
University of St. Thomas is an AWS Educate Institution, you may qualify
for up to $100 in AWS annual credits.

This course makes every effort to stay within the free tier of service at AWS.
However, there are times when your account will likely incur hourly charges. The
free tier of service combined with educational credits should cover almost all of your
expenses. *You are responsible for covering any additional expenses not covered by
these credits.*

Go to http://aws.amazon.com/ and click on the `Sign In` link to sign up for a
new AWS account. You should use your @stthomas.edu email address when signing
up for the account. Also, you need to provide Amazon with a valid credit card during the account setup process otherwise you will not be able to apply for educational credit. Choose the basic support option. The other support options are designed for businesses. We will provide AWS support to one another via the class Slack channel.

*Note, do not select the AWS Educate Starter Account option when signing up for an account.* If you select this option, you *will not* be able to apply for educational credit. Also, make sure you type in the name of your educational institution (University of St. Thomas) on the application form.

Once your AWS account is setup, make note of your AWS Account ID (found in your
account profile on the AWS console). Then, apply for educational credit by filling out an application at: https://www.awseducate.com/Application. It may take a little time for AWS to process your application so submit it as soon as you can.

If AWS accepts your application, you will receive an e-mail containing a special credit code. You need to enter this credit code into your account profile (look in the Billing/Credit Codes section of your AWS account). *AWS will charge your credit card for all service fees if you do not enter the educational credit code into your account.*

In the past, some students have reported that they received a $40 credit instead of the full $100 credit. Students from non-member institutions receive a $40 credit. The University of St. Thomas is an AWS Educate Institution and our students should receive a $100 credit. If you do not receive the full credit amount, you will need to contact AWS support to inform them that you are a student at an AWS Educate Institution.

== Git training (optional)

Online Git training provides a quick introduction to Git where you can
play with some of the basic commands. Students that have not used Git before
are *strongly encouraged* to take this training:
https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git

You can also learn how to use the GitHub website using free online training at these sites:
  
  https://services.github.com/on-demand/
  https://lab.github.com/

In previous semesters Git training was offered as part of this course. However, the use of Git is so common now in industry that students are expected to either have prior experience or the ability to learn it quickly. Your familiarity and comfort level with Git will have a significant impact on your performance in this course. Please plan to invest additional learning time at the beginning of the course if you do not have experiencing working with Git or source control systems.
