== Overview

Exam 2 will cover content from week 8 through week 13 class lectures and assignments. In general, exams will focus on material discussed in lectures. However, this exam will also include questions directly related to some of the weekly assignments. For example, I may ask you to interpret a JSON object or tell me something about an Ansible playbook. If you do not completely understand an assignment, you should go back and practice it again.

The exam will include multiple choice questions and true/false questions. You will have the entire class period to take the exam. The exam is closed book. We will likely use Blackboard to take the exam.
