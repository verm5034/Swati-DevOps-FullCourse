== Overview

Exam 1 will cover content from week 1 through week 6 class lectures and assignments. In general, exams will focus on material discussed in lectures. However, this exam will also include challenges directly related to some of the weekly assignments. For example, I may ask you to create small shell
scripts or to configure a VPC with public and private subnets. If you do not completely understand an assignment, you should go back and practice it again.
