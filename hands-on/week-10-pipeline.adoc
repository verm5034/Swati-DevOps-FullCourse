= SEIS 665 Week 10 Project: Infrastructure Pipeline Part II
Jason Baker <bake2352@stthomas.edu>
1.0, 4/5/2018

== Overview
Create an automated infrastructure pipeline using a Jenkinsfile.

== Requirements

  * AWS account.
  * SSH terminal application.


== The project

Let's get started!

=== Launch Jenkins.

Open up the CloudFormation web console and create a new Jenkins stack by specifying the following S3 URL:

  https://s3.amazonaws.com/seis665/jenkins-cf.json

Recall these input parameters from a previous project:

1. In *JenkinsUsername*, leave the value set to `admin`.
2. In *JenkinsPassword*, set the value to your desired password.

Look at the stack `Outputs` tab to get the IP address of the Jenkins server. You can log into the server using
the following web address (Jenkins runs on port 8080:

    http://<jenkins server IP>:8080


=== Infrastructure Pipeline Setup

A month ago we setup a basic infrastructure pipeline in Jenkins by creating a new pipeline project and
manually entering Groovy code into the project configuration. This week you will create the same sort of 
pipeline but using a Jenkinsfile to store the pipeline definition code. Additionally, you will store this 
Jenkinsfile in a GitHub repository and setup Jenkins to automatically run the pipeline anytime a commit is 
made to the repository. GitHub can trigger Jenkins using a webhook. 

I recommend breaking this project down into the following steps:

1. Create a new public GitHub repository in your personal account called `infrastructure-pipeline`.

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline job called `infrastructure-pipeline`. Configure the new pipeline 
job to use a pipeline script called `Jenkinsfile` located in the GitHub repository you 
created (see lecture presentation p39). You won't need to provide access credentials for Jenkins to 
access this repository because it's public. 

3. Add a file called `Jenkinsfile` to your repository. How should you do this? You could clone the 
repository to your laptop, add the Jenkinsfile, and push the commit back up to GitHub. Another quick 
way to add the file to your repository is to use GitHub's web file editor (https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)
Here's an example Jenkinsfile you can start with. 

    pipeline {
      agent { label 'linux' }
        stages {
          stage('Test') {
            steps {
              sh "env"
            }
          }
        }   
    }

4. Configure the Jenkins pipeline job to trigger builds based on a GitHub webhook (see lecture presentation p27).

5. Configure the GitHub repository with a webhook pointing to your Jenkins server (see lecture 
presentation p26). Make sure you have setup the Jenkins pipeline job before configuring the GitHub webhook.

6. Manually run the build once. The job should automatically clone your repository and execute the pipeline 
steps defined in the Jenkinsfile. From this point on, anytime you commit new changes to the repository the 
job should automatically build. 

7. Create or modify a README.md file in your GitHub repository. Commit the file and verify that Jenkins 
automatically builds the infrastructure-pipeline job.

Okay, you're all set to begin building the pipeline!

=== Create A Pipeline

Create a pipeline with two stages called `GetInstances` and `CreateInstance`. The GetInstances stage will 
retrieve a list of instances in the us-east-1 region.  The CreateInstance stage will launch a new EC2 
instance in your account. The EC2 instance should have the
following characteristics:

    * Use the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI 
    * t2.micro instance type
    * Your EC2 key pair name
    * A valid security group ID associated with your default VPC
    * A valid subnet ID associated with your default VPC

An example `aws` CLI command to launch a new EC2 instance looks like:

    aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-287dnf7 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name seis665 --security-group-ids sg-7edf3108 --subnet-id subnet-0bbd366e --region us-east-1

Note, this example won't work in your pipeline and you will need to modify it for your environment.

Here's some pipeline code to get you started:

....
stage ("GetInstances") {
    steps {
      sh "aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1"
    }
}

stage ("CreateInstance") {
    steps {
      // TODO
    }
}
....

=== Super-sized task (optional)

Add a third stage to your pipeline which automatically terminates the instance after it is running. 

You will need two things to complete this task. The EC2 instance ID created by the AWS `run-instances` command. The `sh` command can return an output value which is assigned to a variable. What does this command look like? Take a look at the `sh` command options in the Jenkins Pipeline Syntax page. 

The AWS CLI command is returning a JSON object. The `jq` command (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is available on 
the build node to parse the JSON output. Here's an example of how to assign a shell command output to a variable:

    def output = sh returnStdout: true, script: 'aws ec2 describe-instances | jq .'

Once the pipeline launches the instance, you need to add a waiter. The purpose of a waiter is to 
literally wait until a specified process completes. In this case, you want the pipeline to wait until
the EC2 instance is running. Hint, check out the `aws ec2 wait` command.


=== Show me your work

Please show me your pipeline code.

=== Terminate AWS resources

Remember to terminate all the resources created in this project, including the EC2 instance created by your
pipeline.
