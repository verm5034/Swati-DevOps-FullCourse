== Overview
Packer is a tool that is commonly used to automate the building of AMIs. We can use Packer to bake our 
software configuration into a server image. In this week's class project, you will create a 
Packer template which uses Ansible to build a basic webserver AMI. 

== Requirements

  * AWS account.
  * SSH terminal application.
  * Packer software or Packer CloudFormation Template
  * Code editor 


== The project

Let's get started!

=== Launch a Packer development environment.

You should review the class powerpoint presentation, Packer documentation, and Ansible documentation 
while working on this project. Here are some documentation links:

    https://www.packer.io/docs/index.html
    http://docs.ansible.com/

You will need to use the Packer software tool to create an AMI. You can either 
download and install the software on your laptop (https://www.packer.io/downloads.html) or launch 
a CloudFormation template which creates a Packer development environment running on an Ubuntu 
linux instance. These instructions assume that you will use the CloudFormation template, but you 
are welcome to try running the software on your laptop. I likely won't be able to help you troubleshoot any software 
installation issues if you attempt to run it locally. 

Here's the CloudFormation template to launch the Packer development environment in AWS regions us-east-1 or us-east-2: 

    https://s3.amazonaws.com/seis665/packer-cf.json

The template will create a stack containing a basic VPC environment:

    * VPC
    * Internet Gateway
    * Public subnet
    * Routing table with an Internet route
    * Packer security group
    * Two input parameters (KeyName and YourIp)

Packer automates the building of EC2 AMIs. It does this by launching a new EC2 instance based on 
a predefined AMI, configuring the instance, and then creating a new AMI based on this modified 
instance. Packer automatically terminates the temporary EC2 instance after the AMI is created.

Launch the stack and shell into the Packer server. This is an Ubuntu linux server so you will need 
to use `ubuntu` as the login username. Once you have logged into the server, type in the command 
`packer version` to verify that the Packer tool is installed and working. It should be installed since 
Packer was used to build the Packer server AMI!

The next step is to create a Packer template which is written as a JSON file. The template has
two main sections: builders and provisioners. The builders section describes what type of image 
Packer should build. In this case we want to use the `amazon-ebs` builder to create an AMI:

    https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs.html

Provisioners describe how to actually configure the image. We will use both the `shell` provisioner 
and the `ansible-local` provisioner. The shell provisioner can run shell script commands to install 
and configure software on the image. The ansible-local provisioner executes an Ansible playbook 
file, which is located in the same directory as your Packer template, on the build image.

    https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/shell.html
    https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/ansible-local.html

When you use Packer to build an AMI, it must use a set of AWS IAM user credentials to access the 
AWS API. Packer is automating the same steps you would do manually, so it needs the ability to 
access AWS just like you do. 

Create a new user in your AWS account called `packer` which only has programmatic access to AWS. 
Attach the `PowerUserAccess` policy to this user account. Normally this policy would probably be 
a little too powerful for this type of use, but for educational purposes it's fine. Make sure you 
record the access key ID and secret key for this new user. 

Now we need to provide these credentials to the Packer tool. There are a couple ways to do this. 
One possibility is to store the credentials directly in the Packer template. I strongly recommend that you 
*never* do this. I know someone that was fired from their job for storing credentials this way 
because it led to a significant corporate security incident.

We'll provide the credentials to Packer by configuring the `aws` CLI using the `aws config` command. 

=== Create a Packer template

Next, create a Packer template called `webserver.json`. You can use the following starter template to build your own 
template:

    https://s3.amazonaws.com/seis665/packer-template.json

You will need to add and define the following properties to the builder section:

    * region
    * ami_name
    * instance_type
    * source_ami
    * ssh_username

The source_ami should be the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI (which means the ssh_username should be 
set to `ec2-user`). The region should be the same as the region the Packer build server is 
running in. You are free to decide what the other values should be.

Once you have created the builder definition, you need to create a shell provisioner. This 
provisioner has a very important task which is to install Ansible software on your new build 
image. Ansible isn't installed by default on the Amazon Linux 2 AMI and if you want to use the 
ansible-local provisioner in Packer you have to install this software on the image first.

Here are the commands your shell provisioner should run:

    sleep 30
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel
    sudo yum install ansible --enablerepo=epel -y

Next, you need to configure the ansible-local provisioner to install an nginx webserver on the 
image. You will do this by defining a local playbook YAML file, called `webserver.yml`, which lives in the same 
directory as your Packer template. Remember that when writing YAML files whitespace and indentation is 
important!

The playbook will only contain a single play which is executed against the local host (the 
server that Packer is building). The play can refer to this host using the special IP 
address `127.0.0.1`. The play needs to perform two tasks: installing the Nginx webserver and 
enabling it to run at boot. The class lecture presentation includes an example of this type of 
playbook.

=== Build the AMI

You are ready to create the AMI once you have created the Packer template and Ansible playbook. 
Initiate the Packer build by running the command:

    packer build webserver.json

Watch as Packer performs a series of steps to automatically build the AMI for you. If Packer 
encounters an error during the build process it will terminate the build and clean up any 
temporary AWS resources it created. Take note of any error messages and fix any issues 
identified in your Packer template or Anisible playbook. It may take 10 minutes or so for 
Packer to completely finish the build process.

You may end up running the Packer build multiple times as you correct different errors in the 
templates. This is pretty common. Sometimes I'll try to build a complex template dozens of 
times before all of the issues are sorted out. This is a very basic template so you should be 
able to get it running without too much effort. If you look at your EC2 web console you will 
see the terminated temporary EC2 instances Packer created for each build.

=== Launch a new webserver

Once Packer successfully creates a new AMI, go ahead and manually launch a new EC2 instance using the new AMI into the VPC created by the Packer stack. Launching a newly built AMI is a common practice and oftentimes we will automate the testing of a 
new AMI after it's built. 

You will need to setup ssh and http access to the new EC2 instance by associating the instance with the `webserverSG` and `packerSG` security groups. Verify that the Nginx webserver is installed and running on the instance. 

You can create a new AMI if the instance you tested isn't working quite right. You will need to 
deregister the new AMI first before running a new Packer build or change the name of the AMI 
that Packer is trying to build. 

Congratulations, you have automated the building of a webserver AMI!

=== 3l173 status (optional)

Modify the template to automatically use the latest version of the Amazon Linux AMI instead of 
actually hardcoding the AMI value into the template. Hint, look at the `source_ami_filter` 
builder property. Additionally, make sure that the AMI that Packer builds is encrypted. 

=== Show me your work

Please show me your template code.

=== Terminate AWS resources

Remember to terminate all the resources created in this project, including the stack created by
the Packer template.
